# To enable ProGuard in your project, edit project.properties
# to define the proguard.config property as described in that file.
#
# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in ${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the ProGuard
# include property in project.properties.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

## Gson SERIALIZER SETTINGS
# See https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/source/browse/trunk/examples/android-proguard-example/proguard.cfg
# Gson uses generic type information stored in a class file when working with fields. Proguard
# removes such information by default, so configure it to keep all of it.
-keepattributes Signature
# Gson specific classes
#-keep class sun.misc.Unsafe { *; }

#if you use public fields instead of setter/getters for your REST POJOs, add this
-keepclassmembers class <you REST POJOs package>.** {
      public <fields>;
}
